## 📊 Executive Summary

This dashboard synthesizes spatial and temporal crime data to identify hotspots, seasonal trends, and operational efficiency. Key findings and recommendations include:

- **Violence & Sexual Offences**: Nightclubs and parking areas are most affected; Mondays, Fridays, and Thursdays see highest counts; peak in **November**; **88%** case follow‑through.
- **Theft from the Person**: Concentrated in nightlife and office zones; Mondays and Thursdays vulnerable; **70%** surge in **August**; **99%** investigative efficiency.
- **Anti‑Social Behaviour**: High counts in night‑life areas; spikes in May, November, March, and December; minimal case resolution (0%); August peak.
- **Disobeying Public Order**: Primarily around nightclubs; Mondays busiest; **22%** spike in **February**; **94%** efficiency.

Overall, Monday emerges as the busiest crime day across categories. Nightclub and parking areas consistently rank as top hotspots. While theft and public‑order offences enjoy strong investigative closure rates (>90%), anti‑social behaviour requires urgent process improvements.

   - Maintain high closure rates for theft and public‑order crimes while exploring automation for initial reporting.

3. **Seasonal Campaigns**  
   - Deploy focused crime‑prevention campaigns in November (violence offences) and February (public‑order surges).
